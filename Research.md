### Q1.1 

### Article 1

**Paradigm:** Interpretivism

The article "Post Graduate Students’ Experiences with Research Ethics: A South African Perspective" written by Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) aligns with the interpretivist paradigm. The authors stated that their qualitative study is underpinned by the interpretivist paradigm (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). The study aims to explore postgraduate students' experiences with research ethics to gain an understanding of the hurdles students encounter when applying for ethics clearance and how they overcome them. When analyzed this study is interpretivism as it is a qualitative study which aims to understand subjective experiences and human interests to gain insight into their meanings and interpretations (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Article 2

**Paradigm:** Positivism

Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje's (2019) study dives into the influence of loyalty programs on South African youth's repeat purchase behaviour, investigating the mediating role of customer satisfaction, trust, and commitment.  The authors wanted to address a literature gap by exploring these combined effects within emerging markets. The study aligns with the positivist paradigm as the authors state they made use of a "quantitative and positivist approach" (Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje, 2019). The research demonstrates positivist telltales through quantitative data collection using a self-administered questionnaire with 263 young participants and statistical analysis via SPSS 22 and IBM Amos 22 (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The study makes use of hypothesis testing to measure relationships between loyalty programs and consumer behaviour, aiming to establish measurable findings which is a hallmark of positivist research.

### Article 3
 
**Paradigm:** Mixed methods

Badaru and Adu (2020) conducted a study titled "University Students’ Media Use and Political Participation in South Africa" which investigates the relationship between university students' media use and their political participation. The authors employed a mixed methods approach, combining questionnaires (Quantitative) and semi-structured interviews (Qualitative) to gather data. The authors sent out questionnaires to 372 students and conducted interviews with 5 student council-selected members (Badaru and Adu, 2020). Given these multiple data collection methods we can classify the study as mixed methods research as it integrates both quantitative and qualitative approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of the research problem (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). 

### Q1.2

**Article 1**

**Research Methodology:** Qualitative

The authors utilized a qualitative research methodology to explore postgraduate students' experiences with research ethics. Within the research paper Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) state that they conducted a "qualitative exploratory study". This is further reinforced by the use of semi-structured interviews which is a common qualitative data collection method according to Busetto, Wick and Gumbinger (2020). The authors used deductive coding to transcribe and analyze the data collected from the interviews, which is a typical approach in qualitative research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). Verbatim quotes were used from the interviews to reinforce the findings, this is another common practice in qualitative research to provide insight into participants' experiences (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 2** 

**Research Methodology** Quantitative

Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) employed a quantitative research methodology to investigate the influence of loyalty programs on South African youth's repeat purchase behaviour. This statement is reinforced by the author's use of a self-administered questionnaire adapted from previous similar studies with data measured using a 7-point Likert scale (Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje, 2019). The Likert scale is commonly used to measure attributes numerically so the finding can be statistically analyzed which primarily aligns with quantitative research methodologies (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The author's study also tested 6 hypotheses using statistical analysis with SPSS 22 and IBM Amos 22, which is a hallmark of quantitative research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 3** Mixed methods

The study conducted by Badaru and Adu (2020) utilized a mixed methods (Combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques) research methodology to explore the relationship between university students' media use and their political participation. The authors made use of stratified random sampling to select 372 students for a questionnaire survey indicating that the authors want to collect metric data which is a common practice in quantitative research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The authors also conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 student council-selected members which is a common qualitative data collection method (Busetto, Wick and Gumbinger, 2020). The combination of these two approaches allows us to conclude that the study is mixed methods as both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were used to conduct the research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).
