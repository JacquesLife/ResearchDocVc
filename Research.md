## Question 1

### Q1.1 

### Article 1

**Paradigm:** Interpretivism

The article "Post Graduate Students’ Experiences with Research Ethics: A South African Perspective" written by Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) aligns with the interpretivist paradigm. The authors stated that their qualitative study is underpinned by the interpretivist paradigm (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). The study aims to explore postgraduate students' experiences with research ethics to gain an understanding of the hurdles students encounter when applying for ethics clearance and how they overcome them. When analyzed this study is interpretivism as it is a qualitative study which aims to understand subjective experiences and human interests to gain insight into their meanings and interpretations (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Article 2

**Paradigm:** Positivism

Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje's (2019) study dives into the influence of loyalty programs on South African youth's repeat purchase behaviour, investigating the mediating role of customer satisfaction, trust, and commitment.  The authors wanted to address a literature gap by exploring these combined effects within emerging markets. The study aligns with the positivist paradigm as the authors state they made use of a "quantitative and positivist approach" (Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje, 2019). The research demonstrates positivist telltales through quantitative data collection using a self-administered questionnaire with 263 young participants and statistical analysis via SPSS 22 and IBM Amos 22 (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The study makes use of hypothesis testing to measure relationships between loyalty programs and consumer behaviour, aiming to establish measurable findings which is a hallmark of positivist research.

### Article 3
 
**Paradigm:** Critical realism

Badaru and Adu (2020) conducted a study titled "University Students’ Media Use and Political Participation in South Africa" which investigates the relationship between university students' media use and their political participation. The authors employed a critical realist approach, combining questionnaires (Quantitative) and semi-structured interviews (Qualitative) to gather data. The authors sent out questionnaires to 372 students and conducted interviews with 5 student council-selected members (Badaru and Adu, 2020). Given these multiple data collection methods we can classify the study as critical realism as it integrates both quantitative and qualitative approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of the research problem (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). 

### Q1.2

**Article 1**

**Research Methodology:** Qualitative

The authors utilized a qualitative research methodology to explore postgraduate students' experiences with research ethics. Within the research paper Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) state that they conducted a "qualitative exploratory study". This is further reinforced by the use of semi-structured interviews which is a common qualitative data collection method according to Busetto, Wick and Gumbinger (2020). The authors used deductive coding to transcribe and analyze the data collected from the interviews, which is a typical approach in qualitative research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). Verbatim quotes were used from the interviews to reinforce the findings, this is another common practice in qualitative research to provide insight into participants' experiences (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 2** 

**Research Methodology** Quantitative

Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) employed a quantitative research methodology to investigate the influence of loyalty programs on South African youth's repeat purchase behaviour. This statement is reinforced by the author's use of a self-administered questionnaire adapted from previous similar studies with data measured using a 7-point Likert scale (Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje, 2019). The Likert scale is commonly used to measure attributes numerically so the finding can be statistically analyzed which primarily aligns with quantitative research methodologies (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The author's study also tested 6 hypotheses using statistical analysis with SPSS 22 and IBM Amos 22, which is a hallmark of quantitative research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 3** Mixed methods

The study conducted by Badaru and Adu (2020) utilized a mixed methods (Combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques) research methodology to explore the relationship between university students' media use and their political participation. The authors made use of stratified random sampling to select 372 students for a questionnaire survey indicating that the authors want to collect metric data which is a common practice in quantitative research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The authors also conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 student council-selected members which is a common qualitative data collection method (Busetto, Wick and Gumbinger, 2020). The combination of these two approaches allows us to conclude that the study is mixed methods as both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were used to conduct the research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q1.3

**Research Problem:** The research problem is a researchers most appropriate first step when conducting research as it sets the stage (scope, direction, and focus) for the entire research process (Madhu et al., 2024). The research problem is a statement, question, or issue that a researcher wants to further investigate or understand (Madhu et al., 2024).

**Article 1:** 

**Problem Statement:** Lack of sufficient sufficient qualitative research on the experiences of postgraduate students in South Africa regarding research ethics and the ethical clearance process.

The problem statement in Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi's (2023) article align well with the definition of a research problem presented above as it identifies a specific issue (Postgraduate students' experiences with research ethics and the ethical clearance process) and highlights a gap in existing literature (lack of sufficient qualitative research on this topic). Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) problem statement fits Madhu et al. (2024) identified criteria of a research problem statement as it provides a clear focus for their study and sets the stage for further investigation into the experiences of postgraduate students in South Africa regarding research ethics.

**Article 2:**

**Problem Statement:** Poor understanding, particularly within emerging markets regarding the youth and how loyalty programs influence their repeat purchase behavior, considering the mediating role of customer satisfaction, trust, and commitment. 

By dicecting the problem statement in Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje's (2019) article, it is evident that it matches Madhu et al. (2024) definition of a research problem as it identifies a specific issue (poor understanding of loyalty programs' influence on repeat purchase behavior among South African youth) and highlights a gap in existing literature (Poor understanding of this topic within emerging markets). We can conclude that the problem statement in Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje's (2019) article provides a clear focus for their study and leaves room for further exploration of the topic, thus fitting the criteria of a research problem as defined by Madhu et al. (2024).
**Article 3:** 

**Problem Statement:** low political participation among university students in South Africa and the lack of empirical research data examining the relationship between media use and political participation.

Given the definition of a research problem identified above, the research problem "low political participation among university students in South Africa and the lack of empirical research data examining the relationship between media use and political participation" fits the criteria as it identifies a specific issue (low political participation) and highlights a gap in existing research (lack of empirical data on media use and political participation). Badaru and Adu (2020) problem statement fits the identified criteria of a research problem as it sets the stage for their study by addressing a specific issue that requires further investigation and understanding according to Madhu et al. (2024).

### Q1.4

**Article 1:** 

**Population** Post graduate students who have completed their studies and graduated from South African universities.

The researchers Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi's (2023) solely focused on postgraduate students who graduated between the years 2018 and 2021 from South African universities with a master or doctoral degree. The sample group according to Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) consisted of "12 participants 8 being master's students and 4 being doctoral students". The indaviduals were selected from 8 different universities across 5 provinces in South Africa each representing different fields of study (Sciences, Humanities, and Management). These are finely selected individuals matching the du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) exxamples of an accessible group of individuals that the researcher wants to study.

**Population Parameters:** 
The population parameters for the study according Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) and du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) are as follows:

- Postgraduate students from various South African universities.
- Students with various fields of study (Sciences, Humanities, and Management).
- Students who graduated between 2018 and 2021.
- Master and doctoral students.

**Article 2:** 

**Population** South African youth who are members of loyalty programs

The population covered in the article by Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) consist of South African youth who are members of loyalty programs. The sample group covered consisted of students from the University of Witwatersrand (77.6% female and 22.4% male) where over 50% of students were aged 18 - 20 years old. The students all participated in various loyalty schemes within a range of industries (food, clothing, and health and beauty sectors). This makes for a clear target population as defined by du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) as a clearly defined group of individuals which the researchers aims to study.

**Population Parameters:**
The population parameters for the study according Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) and du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) are as follows:

- Proportion of South African youth enrolled in loyalty programs (aged 18 -24 years old).
- mean level of customer satisfaction.
- Proportion of youth who engage in repeat purchase behavior.
- Average satisfaction levels with loyalty programs.
- Average perception of trust and commitment towards loyalty programs.


**Article 3:**

**Population** University students in South Africa

The source presented by Badaru and Adu (2020) focuses on university students in South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province with the sample including 60.5% male and 39.5% female students within the age range of 21 - 25 years old. The following match du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) criteria for a target population a specific accessible group of individuals that the researcher wants to study.

**Population Parameters:** 
The population parameters for the study according Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) and du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) are as follows:

- Proportion of students enrolled within South African universities (by gender).
- mean age (21 - 25 years old),
- media habits (types and frequency). 
- Average levels of political participation.

## Q1.5

**Article 1:**

**Sampling Method:** Purposive sampling and snowball sampling 

**Advantages:** Set charecteristics of participants ensure that the sample is relevant to the research problem meaning they all provide value according to du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021). With snowball sampling the advantage is locating difficult-to-reach participants and essentially just streamlines this process (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

The following research by Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) falls into the category of purposive sampling and snowball sampling. We can see the element of purposive sampling as the authors specifically selected postgraduate students who had graduated from South African universities between 2018 and 2021. These participants match key characteristics identfied by the researchers then selected based on these same characteristics (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). Snowball sampling is also evident in the study as the researchers used Twitter to recruit participants, asking those who already participated to retweet the post to expand the researchers particapant pool. Since refferals were used to referals were used to increase the sample size, this is a clear example of snowball sampling (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 2:** 

**Sampling Method:** Convenience sampling

**Advantages:** Quick and easy access to participants, which makes for fast and cost-effective data collection (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). 

The Research conducted by Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) utilized covinience sampling as the participants were selected specifically from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who were easily accessible to the researchers. The authors admisnistered a self-administered questionnaire to the students ages 18 -24 years old from the university of Witwatersrand. The researchers clearly had easy acess to students at this university as the sample was taken from a single university, which is a clear example of convenience sampling as the name suggest (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 3:**

**Sampling Method:** Stratified random sampling and purposive sampling

**Advantages:** The advantage of stratified randon sampling is that it ensures that the subgroups (strata) within the population are represented efectively (proportionally) according to du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021). This is useful as experiances may differ between the subgroups (faculties). Pruposive sampling allowed the reasearchers in this instance allowed the researchers to select the students council-selected members who matched their specific characteristics of interest, ensuring that each element is aligned with their research du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) identified.

The study conducted by Badaru and Adu (2020) made use of two sampling methods, stratified random sampling for the quantitative component and purposive sampling for the qualitative component. The authors surveyed 372 students from various faculties (strata) within the Eastern Cape university. The population coincides with du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) definition of stratified random sampling being the population was divided into clear subgroups (faculties) and then a random sample was taken from each subgroup. Purposive sampling was utilized for the qualitative component of the study where 5 student council-selected members were interviewed through semi-structured interviews. These students were selected as they posed certian key characteristics that the researchers wanted to study, which is a clear example of purposive sampling (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q1.6

**Article 1:**

**Data Collection Method:** Personal semi-structured interviews

Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) utilised semi-structured interviews as their feild primary data collection method. They interviewed 12 postgraduate students through MS Teams in 50 - 60 minute interview sessions (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). One researcher conducted the interviews transcribing the auido and taking verbatim quotes from the participants (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). By analyzing this approach we can clearly see that the authors took a semi-structured approach to the interviews as they asked open-ended questions, allowed for follow-up questions, and allowed the participants to share their experiences in their own words (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). 

**Article 2:**

**Data Collection Method:** Self-administered questionnaire 

The research conducted by Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) utilized a self-administered questionnaires to collect data from their participants. The authors sampled 263 students ages 18 - 24 utilising a 7-point Likert scale to measure the participants' responses (Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje, 2019). This is an example of self-administered questionnaires as the participants completed the questionnaire without the presence of the researchers in their own time (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). 

**Article 3:**

**Data Collection Method:** Questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews

The study conducted by Badaru and Adu (2020) utilized a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews as their data collection methods. The authors sent questionnaires to 372 students from various faculties within the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. This matches du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) definition of a questionnaire survey as it most likely consisted of closed-ended questions admisntered to a large sample size to collect quantitative data. The authors used semi-structured interviews with 5 student student council members to gather qualitative data. The interviews had a researcher present to ask questions and get follow-up responses from the participants, which indicates that the authors used a semi-structured approach to the interviews (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q1.7

**Article 1:**

**Key Findings:** The authors Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) found the following key findings in their study:

- 58% of had not recieved any formal research ethics training.
- 69% of students did receive support and guidance from academic supervisors.
- 67% of students where unfamiliar with their unversity's research ethics policy.
- 93% of students had a positve perception of the research ethics clearance process.

With these crucial findings the authors Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) recommend that unvisities in South Africa should expose students to research ethics training at the undergraduate level ensuring that they are well-prepared for the ethical clearance process in their postgraduate sudies.

**Implications and Insights:** Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) made the assumption that ethical clearance is crucial when conducting research with people and that postgraduate students frequently use human participants in their research. Once the research had been conducted Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) concluded that more research is needed within the topic of research ethics and that more teaching support should be provided to postgraduate students in South Africa.

**Article 2:**

**Key Findings:** Sipihiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) noticed the following key findings in their study:

- All 6 hypotheses were supported. 
- loyalty programs have a postive and direct influence on customer satisfaction, trust, and commitment.
- Customer satisfaction has a direct influence on repeat purchase behavior.
- Customer satisfaction is a significant mediator between loyalty programs and repeat purchase behavior.

The authors Sipihiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) concluded that building customer satisfaction amongst the youth marketers can have a positeve impact on loyalty programs and repeat purchase behavior. 

**Implications and Insights** The authors Sipihiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) believe that loyalty programs are a great retention tool for bussinesses to maintain a customer base and that their primary value lies in increasing sales amongst loyal customers. In conducting this study due to the lack of empirical research on the topic the authors Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) were able to reinforce and test their hypotheses. 

**Article 3:**

**Key Findings:** The authors Badaru and Adu (2020) noted the following key findings within their study:

- The majority of students 65.3% used social media as their primary source of political information.
- 49.2% of students voted for Student Representative Council (SRC) members.
- 30.4% of students voted in the 2014 National Elections.
- Media use has a postitve influence on political participation.

The authors Badaru and Adu (2020) study found that media use, mainly social media, has a positive influence on political participation anong university students in South Africa. They noted that social media usage influences politcal participation outside of university capmpuses, such as national elections.

**Implications and Insights:** Badaru and Adu (2020) believe that the survival of democracy in South Africa depends on active politcal participation and that South African democracy is at risk due to low political participation rates amongst the youth. Badaru and Adu (2020) suggest that mass media usage is a crucial vector in increasing political participation and that digitization is reshaping the political landscape in South Africa, therfore tapping into this potential will be crucial for increasing political participation rates amongs the youth.

### Q1.8

**Article 1:** Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) ensured the validity of their study by making use of a technique called member checking. This technique invloves sharing the research findings with the participants to ensure that they have accuratly captured their experiences and interpretations (Birt et al., 2016). The authors also utlised data source traingulation were multiple data soruces (litrature, interviews, documents) are used to collect data which enhances the credibility of the findings (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The researchers Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) also ensured that they obtain the neccessary ethical clearance from the participants before conducting interviews which ensures intergrity. By ensuring both vailidity and reliability as established above the authors Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) are able to provide a trustworthy and credible study according to Eldridge (2015).

**Article 2:** To ensure trustworthiness in their study, Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) by adapting research intrauments from similar previous studies to ensure validity and reliability. To further enhance validity and reliability Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) conducted a pre-test of the questionnaire was done with 10 students to ensure that the questions are clear and understandable to the participants. Finally various statistical tests were done to ensure the reliability of the model and the data collected Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023). All the above factor contribute to the trustworhiness of the study by combining both reliability and validity techniques and tests we can conclude that the study matches the criteria for trustworthiness as identified by Eldridge (2015). 

**Article 3:** 
For Badaru and Adu (2020) to ensure trustworthiness in their study they sought the opinions of experts in their feild to validate their data collection instruments as well as conducted a pilot test to further test their research instruments for reliability. Finaly to ensure intergrity the authors obtiained the necessary ethical clearance and approval from the university of Fort Hare before conducting the study. By ensuring these three pillars of trustworthiness (validity, reliability, and integrity) the authors Badaru and Adu (2020) were able to provide a trustworthy and credible study matching the criteria laid out by Ahmed (2024) and Eldridge (2015). 

### Q1.9

**Article 1:** Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) research paper being a study on ethical clearance they were particluarly aware of the ethical implications of their research approaching it with great diligence. Before conducting the study the authors an informative letter was sent to all potential participants explaining the purpose of the study as well as a consent form. During the interviews formal consent was obtained again with participants signing a consent form before the interview began (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). Psudonnymes were given to participants to ensure their anoymity and confidentiality (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). However, the authors still faced challenges after the interviews such as not providing the university names in the reoprting phase and the secure storage of the audio recordings and transcripts (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). The researchers Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) clearly took precautions and made an effect to ensure that participants responses and identities were confedential and used member checking to ensure accuaracy alligning with du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) criteria for ethical research.

**Article 2:** Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) did not dive deep into the ethical implications within their published research paper. Before the study was conducted the authors Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) did not mention any ethical clearance or consent forms being sent to the participants. However, the stated that the did ensure visibility through the completion of the self-administered questionnaire to maintain data quality during the data collection process. The authors used convenience sampling and stated that their is no guarantee that participants were transparent in their responses (Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje, 2019). Their is also no mention of secure data storage after the study was conducted which is a necessary step in ethical research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). It is possible that the nature of the study did not require ecessive clearance or ethical implications or that the authors did not touch on this process in their published research paper. However, the lack of depth and transparency into ethical issues within the study does raise concerns about the study's integrity according the criteria set out by du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021).

**Article 3:** To adress ethical implications within their study, Badaru and Adu (2020) obtained ethical clearance from the university of Fort Hare before conducting the study to ensure ligitimacy and integrity. During the study itself the authors made an effort to explain the purpose of the study to the participants and obtain formal consent before participating in the study (Badaru and Adu, 2020). However, the authors did not mention anyhting about anonymity, confidentiality and secure response storage after the study was conducted. The authors did take ethics into account for the most part adressing how the handle ethics within the before and during stage however, seemed to overlook the after stage of the research process. This is still a noble effort matching most of the criteria set out by du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) for ethical research.

### Q1.10

**Article 1:** 

**Gaps and Limitations:** I noticed the following gaps and limitations within the study conducted by Makola and Ntyoanto-Tyatyantsi (2023):

- The small sample size of 12 participants 
- Limited to posgraduate students from 8 different universities in South Africa.
- Study took place during the COVID-19 pandemic which disrupted normal academic processes.
- Snowball sampling skewed proportions of participants feild of study (Sciences, Humanities, and Management) as the majority of participants were from Bussiness related feilds.

The authors also noted these gaps and limitations within their study, however, they did not mention COVID-19 as a limiting factor. I believe the disruption COVID caused to day-to-day academic processes may have skewed education surrounding research ethics and the ethical clearance process as the lack of in-person training and workshops would not have been available to students. The study spans from 2018 to 2021, which is essential infomation as the pandemic started in 2020 which could have impacted results especially for the 2020 and 2021 participants.

**Unexplored Aspects:** I believe that the study conducted by Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) could be expanded upon in the following ways:

- Make use of Quantitative data collection methods to gather more data from a lager sample size.
- Interview academic supervisors and university staff to gain a holstic view of the research ethics and ethical clearance process.
- Compare undergraduate and postgraduate students experiences with research ethics and the ethical clearance process.
- Effects of COVID-19 on the research ethics and ethical clearance process.

With these expantions and suggestions the study could potentially be more effective in addressing the research problem or provide an area for future researchers to explore. Intially I believe just expanding the sample size to larger than 12 participants would be a good start as I dont believe that it is enough to draw any significant conclusions from.

**Article 2:** 

**Gaps and Limitations:** I noticed the follwong gaos and limitations within the study conducted by Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019):

- The study only included students from the University of Witwatersrand within the Gauteng province.
- Increase the age parameters to include a range of participants.
- Lack of Qualitative data on a research topic that seems quite subjective.
- Types of loyalty programs were not taken into account.

The authors did mention two of these four limitations within their study but did not consider the lack of qualitative data and the types of loyalty programs as a limitation. I believe that the authors use of convenience sampling is limiting the study as it could easily provide more insightful results if they conducted the study across multiple universities in South Africa.


**Unexplored Aspects:** I believe that the study conducted by Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) could be improved or further researched in the following ways:

- Explore if insatutions promote the use of loyalty programs to students.
- Analize the effectiveness of different types of loyalty programs on repeat purchase behavior.
- Conduct semi-structured interviews with participants to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences with loyalty programs.
- Compare the effectiveness of loyalty programs across different industries (food, healthcare, clothing, etc.).

The above suggestions I have made could potentially highlight areas for further improvement or expansion within the study. Initially just expanding the sampling to multiple universities in South Africa would be a good area to explore instead of just the University of Witwatersrand. I also believe segmenting the types of loyalty programs across multiple industries would provide more insight into the topic and heald more reliable results. 

**Article 3:** 

**Gaps and Limitations:** I believe that the following gaps and limitations are present within Badaru and Adu's (2020) study:

- The study was conducted at one university in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.
- Few socail media platforms were considered primarily Facebook and Twitter.
- Study is only limited to university students and does not consider the non-student youth population.
- Provincial effects (cultural, economic, and political) on media use and political participation were not considered.

I noticed the follwing gaps and limitations within the study the authors only noted the study being limited to one university in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. I believe the study has more limitations such as limited data on newer social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram which have become increasingly popular especially among the youth. The study also speeks about the apathy of youth towards political participation but only includes university students in the study whithout considering the non-student youth population. Finally provincial effects such as culural, economic, and political factors were not mentioned or considered.

**Unexplored Aspects:**

- Expanding the study to include multiple universities across multiple provinces in South Africa.
- Including non-student youth to gain a deeper understanding of media use and political participation.
- Measuring which social media platforms are most effective in increasing political participation.
- Exploring locational factors such as rural vs urban areas and if they have an effect on media use and political participation.

Much like Article 2, I believe that expanding the study to include multiple universities across multiple provinces in South Africa would be a great area for future research. The authors should also consider including the non-student youth to gain deeper insights to further reinforce their findings. A more granular approach to social media platforms could help further understand which platforms are most effective in increasing political participation. These suggestions I believe provide unexplored aspects and grounds to conduct further research into the topic of media use and political participation among university students in South Africa.


## Question 2:

### Q2.1

**Article 1:** Post Graduate Students’ Experiences with Research Ethics: A South African Perspective

**Alternate Paradigm:** Positivism 

**Article 2:** The influence of loyalty programs on South African Youth’s repeat purchase behaviour

**Alternate Paradigm:** Critical Realism

**Article 3:** University Students’ Media Use and Political Participation in South Africa

**Alternate Paradigm:** Interpretivism

### Q2.2

### Q2.2.1

**Article 1:** Post Graduate Students’ Experiences with Research Ethics: A South African Perspective

**Research Problem:** The lack of sufficient imperical research on South African students examining the relationship formal ethics training, instatutional support has on their understanding of research ethics and the ethical clearance process. This adapted research problem aligns better with the positivist approach as it now aims to measure the relationship between variables through observable data (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q2.2.2

**Research Questions:**

1. What is the relationship between formal ethics training and postgraduate students' understanding of the research ethics and ethical clearance process?

2. What is the relationship between institutional support levels and the ethics compliance mannerisms of postgraduate students?

3. What percentage of postgraduate students have formal ethics training in South African universities?

### Q2.2.3
**Hypotheses:** Postgraduate students who have received formal ethics training will handle the ethical clearance process more effectively than those who have not received formal ethics training.

### Q2.2.4

**Target Population:** All students enrolled in posgraduate programs conducting research requiring ethical clearance at South African universities.

**Accessible Population:** Postgraduate students enrolled in research programs across seperate universities within South Africa who can be reached through mail or official university channels.

**Parameters:** 

- Students enrolled in postgraduate programs (Master's and Doctoral).
- Students who have completed or are currently conducting research requiring ethical clearance.

**Unit of analysis:** Individual postgraduate students


**Article 2:** The influence of loyalty programs on South African Youth’s repeat purchase behaviour

### Q2.2.1

**Research Problem:** Young ustomers experiances with loyalty programs and how it influences their repeat purchase behavior. With interpretivism being the alternate paradigm, the research now takes a more subjective approach to understanding customers' experiences and perceptions of loyalty programs (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q2.2.2

**Research Questions:**

**Article 3:** University Students’ Media Use and Political Participation in South Africa

### Q2.2.1

**Research Problem:** As thier is a decline in political participation among university students in South Africa, it is emperative to understand students perceptions and understanding how there use of media influences their political participation. This alternative interpretivist apprach seeks to uderstand the subjective experiences of students rather than just measuring observable data (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q2.2.2
**Research Questions:**
1. How do university students in South Africa use media to engage with politics?
2. How do university students perceive the influence of media on their political participation?
3. Have students ever participated in political activities as a result of media exposure?

### Q2.2.3
**Research Objectives:**
1. To understand which media vectors university students in South Africa use to engage with politics.
2. To explore students perceptions of the influence of media on their political participation.
3. Understanding what causes students to participate in political activities as a result of media exposure.
   
### Q2.2.4

**Target Population:** university students in South Africa who use media.

**Accessible Population:** University students from various backgrounds who are willing to share their medua use and political participation experiences through interviews. 

**Parameters:**

- University students in South Africa.
- Must use media (social media, news, etc.) to engage with politics.
- Willing to participate in interviews.

**Unit of analysis:** Indavidual university students who use media to engage with politics.

### Q2.2.5 

**Article 1:**

**Sampling Method:** Stratified random sampling 

With a more quantitative approach to the study conducted by Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) we will have to revaluate the sampling method to accommodate the new research problem and objectives. Stratified random sampling fits the requirments as it allows us to divide the postgraduate student into subgorups (strata) based on characteristics such as field of study, university type , and level of education (Master's or Doctoral). With this method we can ensure genralised measurable findings across the entire population of postgraduate students according to du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021). I believe this approach is appropriate for the alternate paradigm of positivism as it seeks to enlighten and measure the relationship between variables (observable data) rather than just understanding subjective experiences which alligns with du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) definition of positivism.

**Article 2:**

**Sampling Method:** Mixed methods sampling (stratified random sampling and purposive sampling)

With the new paradigm being critical realism, we will have to combine elements of both quantitative and qualitative sampling methods to match this new criteria. Once agian I believe stratisfied random sampling is the best approach as it allows us to divide the youth population into subgroups (strata) based on characteristics such as age, type of loyalty program, and geographic location. This will helps us classify our quantitative data and ensure that we represent the youth population effectively according to du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021). For the qualitative component we can make use of purposive sampling to indentify set characteristics of participants, esspecially when conducting interviews (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). With this combined approach we can meet the criteria for critical realism and gain a deeper understanding of the youth's experiences with loyalty programs while still measuring observable data (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 3:**

**Sampling Method:** Snoqwball sampling

I believe snowball sampling is the best approach for the new interpretivist paradigm as it allows us to reach a wide range of participants through referrals from existing participants. This method is effective for qualitative research and as a parameter already being media users it may make it easier to find participants (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). This can also help to expand behond the university setting and reach more diverse participants who use media to engage with politics. I believe snowballing to be a suitable approach for this study as it allows us to gather large amounts of qualitative data from a diverse group of participants with a focus on volume giving us a deep insight into the subjective experiences of university students in South Africa (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q2.2.6

**Article 1:**

**Data Collection Method:** Questionnaire survey

With the newly identified positivist paradigm, a questionnaire would be more appropriate form of data collection as it allows for the collection of quantitative data from a larger sample size. A Likert scale questionnaire to be more specfic would allow us to identify patterns and statistical relationships between variables such as formal ethics training, institutional support, and understanding of the ethical clearance process (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). With this numerical data collect researchers can then analyze the effectiveness of formal ethics training and institutional support on postgraduate students' to prove the hypothesis that postgraduate srudents who have received formal ethics training will handle this process more effectively than those who have not.

**Article 2:** Questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews

To achive the goals of the critical realism paradigm, we will need to take a mixed methods approach collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. With this being said we can acheive this by using a questionnaire survey to collect quantitative data on the youth's experiences with loyalty programs and their repeat purchase behavior. For the qualitative component we can use semi-structured interviews to gain a subjective understanding of the youth's perceptions and experiences with loyalty programs. With this approach we can collect observable data and gain an undestanding of social phenomena align with the critical realism paradigm (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 3:** Focus groups 

To successfully collect qualitative data for the interpretivist paradigm, we can employ focus groups as our data collection method. Focus groups guided by a facilitator can help us collectively explore the subjective experiences of university students regarding their media use and political participation. This can promote open discussions and cause the students to share their experiences in a more natural and interactive setting (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). Another benifit is to gather shared experiances giving us a deeper understanding of the social phenomena at play. Focus groups are common in interpretivist research as their primary focus is on understanding perceptions and experiences (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q2.2.7 

**Article 1:** 

**Data Analysis Method:** Statistical analysis


**Article 2:** Mixed methods analysis (satistical analysis and thematic analysis)


**Article 3:** Thematic analysis
