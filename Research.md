## Question 1

### Q1.1 

### Article 1

**Paradigm:** Interpretivism

The article "Post Graduate Students’ Experiences with Research Ethics: A South African Perspective" written by Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) aligns with the interpretivist paradigm. The authors stated that their qualitative study is underpinned by the interpretivist paradigm (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). The study aims to explore postgraduate students' experiences with research ethics to gain an understanding of the hurdles students encounter when applying for ethics clearance and how they overcome them. When analyzed this study is interpretivism as it is a qualitative study which aims to understand subjective experiences and human interests to gain insight into their meanings and interpretations (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Article 2

**Paradigm:** Positivism

Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje's (2019) study dives into the influence of loyalty programs on South African youth's repeat purchase behaviour, investigating the mediating role of customer satisfaction, trust, and commitment.  The authors wanted to address a literature gap by exploring these combined effects within emerging markets. The study aligns with the positivist paradigm as the authors state they made use of a "quantitative and positivist approach" (Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje, 2019). The research demonstrates positivist telltales through quantitative data collection using a self-administered questionnaire with 263 young participants and statistical analysis via SPSS 22 and IBM Amos 22 (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The study makes use of hypothesis testing to measure relationships between loyalty programs and consumer behaviour, aiming to establish measurable findings which is a hallmark of positivist research.

### Article 3
 
**Paradigm:** Mixed methods

Badaru and Adu (2020) conducted a study titled "University Students’ Media Use and Political Participation in South Africa" which investigates the relationship between university students' media use and their political participation. The authors employed a mixed methods approach, combining questionnaires (Quantitative) and semi-structured interviews (Qualitative) to gather data. The authors sent out questionnaires to 372 students and conducted interviews with 5 student council-selected members (Badaru and Adu, 2020). Given these multiple data collection methods we can classify the study as mixed methods research as it integrates both quantitative and qualitative approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of the research problem (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). 

### Q1.2

**Article 1**

**Research Methodology:** Qualitative

The authors utilized a qualitative research methodology to explore postgraduate students' experiences with research ethics. Within the research paper Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) state that they conducted a "qualitative exploratory study". This is further reinforced by the use of semi-structured interviews which is a common qualitative data collection method according to Busetto, Wick and Gumbinger (2020). The authors used deductive coding to transcribe and analyze the data collected from the interviews, which is a typical approach in qualitative research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). Verbatim quotes were used from the interviews to reinforce the findings, this is another common practice in qualitative research to provide insight into participants' experiences (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 2** 

**Research Methodology** Quantitative

Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) employed a quantitative research methodology to investigate the influence of loyalty programs on South African youth's repeat purchase behaviour. This statement is reinforced by the author's use of a self-administered questionnaire adapted from previous similar studies with data measured using a 7-point Likert scale (Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje, 2019). The Likert scale is commonly used to measure attributes numerically so the finding can be statistically analyzed which primarily aligns with quantitative research methodologies (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The author's study also tested 6 hypotheses using statistical analysis with SPSS 22 and IBM Amos 22, which is a hallmark of quantitative research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 3** Mixed methods

The study conducted by Badaru and Adu (2020) utilized a mixed methods (Combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques) research methodology to explore the relationship between university students' media use and their political participation. The authors made use of stratified random sampling to select 372 students for a questionnaire survey indicating that the authors want to collect metric data which is a common practice in quantitative research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The authors also conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 student council-selected members which is a common qualitative data collection method (Busetto, Wick and Gumbinger, 2020). The combination of these two approaches allows us to conclude that the study is mixed methods as both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were used to conduct the research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q1.3

**Research Problem:** The research problem is a researchers most appropriate first step when conducting research as it sets the stage (scope, direction, and focus) for the entire research process (Madhu et al., 2024). The research problem is a statement, question, or issue that a researcher wants to further investigate or understand (Madhu et al., 2024).

**Article 1:** 

**Problem Statement:** Lack of sufficient sufficient qualitative research on the experiences of postgraduate students in South Africa regarding research ethics and the ethical clearance process.

The problem statement in Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi's (2023) article align well with the definition of a research problem presented above as it identifies a specific issue (Postgraduate students' experiences with research ethics and the ethical clearance process) and highlights a gap in existing literature (lack of sufficient qualitative research on this topic). Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) problem statement fits Madhu et al. (2024) identified criteria of a research problem statement as it provides a clear focus for their study and sets the stage for further investigation into the experiences of postgraduate students in South Africa regarding research ethics.

**Article 2:**

**Problem Statement:** Poor understanding, particularly within emerging markets regarding the youth and how loyalty programs influence their repeat purchase behavior, considering the mediating role of customer satisfaction, trust, and commitment. 

By dicecting the problem statement in Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje's (2019) article, it is evident that it matches Madhu et al. (2024) definition of a research problem as it identifies a specific issue (poor understanding of loyalty programs' influence on repeat purchase behavior among South African youth) and highlights a gap in existing literature (Poor understanding of this topic within emerging markets). We can conclude that the problem statement in Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje's (2019) article provides a clear focus for their study and leaves room for further exploration of the topic, thus fitting the criteria of a research problem as defined by Madhu et al. (2024).
**Article 3:** 

**Problem Statement:** low political participation among university students in South Africa and the lack of empirical research data examining the relationship between media use and political participation.

Given the definition of a research problem identified above, the research problem "low political participation among university students in South Africa and the lack of empirical research data examining the relationship between media use and political participation" fits the criteria as it identifies a specific issue (low political participation) and highlights a gap in existing research (lack of empirical data on media use and political participation). Badaru and Adu (2020) problem statement fits the identified criteria of a research problem as it sets the stage for their study by addressing a specific issue that requires further investigation and understanding according to Madhu et al. (2024).

### Q1.4

**Article 1:** 

**Population** Post graduate students who have completed their studies and graduated from South African universities.

The researchers Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi's (2023) solely focused on postgraduate students who graduated between the years 2018 and 2021 from South African universities with a master or doctoral degree. The sample group according to Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) consisted of "12 participants 8 being master's students and 4 being doctoral students". The indaviduals were selected from 8 different universities across 5 provinces in South Africa each representing different fields of study (Sciences, Humanities, and Management). These are finely selected individuals matching the du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) exxamples of an accessible group of individuals that the researcher wants to study.

**Population Parameters:** 
The population parameters for the study according Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) and du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) are as follows:

- Experiences with research ethics training received (58% of students attended workshops).
- Experiences with support and guidance received from supervisors (69% of students received guidance).
- Students who were familiar with their university's research ethics policies (67% of students were familiar).
- Students who applied Research Ethics Principles in their research projects (72% of students applied principles).

**Article 2:** 

**Population** South African youth who are members of loyalty programs

The population covered in the article by Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) consist of South African youth who are members of loyalty programs. The sample group covered consisted of students from the University of Witwatersrand (77.6% female and 22.4% male) where over 50% of students were aged 18 - 20 years old. The students all participated in various loyalty schemes within a range of industries (food, clothing, and health and beauty sectors). This makes for a clear target population as defined by du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) as a clearly defined group of individuals which the researchers aims to study.

**Population Parameters:**
The population parameters for the study according Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) and du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) are as follows:

- Proportion of South African youth enrolled in loyalty programs (aged 18 -24 years old).
- mean level of customer satisfaction.
- Proportion of youth who engage in repeat purchase behavior.
- Average satisfaction levels with loyalty programs.
- Average perception of trust and commitment towards loyalty programs.


**Article 3:**

**Population** University students in South Africa

The source presented by Badaru and Adu (2020) focuses on university students in South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province with the sample including 60.5% male and 39.5% female students within the age range of 21 - 25 years old. The following match du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) criteria for a target population a specific accessible group of individuals that the researcher wants to study.

**Population Parameters:** 
The population parameters for the study according Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) and du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) are as follows:

- Proportion of students enrolled within South African universities (by gender).
- mean age (21 - 25 years old),
- media habits (types and frequency). 
- Average levels of political participation.

## Q1.5

**Article 1:**

**Sampling Method:** Purposive sampling and snowball sampling 

**Advantages:** Set charecteristics of participants ensure that the sample is relevant to the research problem meaning they all provide value according to du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021). With snowball sampling the advantage is locating difficult-to-reach participants and essentially just streamlines this process (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

The following research by Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) falls into the category of purposive sampling and snowball sampling. We can see the element of purposive sampling as the authors specifically selected postgraduate students who had graduated from South African universities between 2018 and 2021. These participants match key characteristics identfied by the researchers then selected based on these same characteristics (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). Snowball sampling is also evident in the study as the researchers used Twitter to recruit participants, asking those who already participated to retweet the post to expand the researchers particapant pool. Since refferals were used to referals were used to increase the sample size, this is a clear example of snowball sampling (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 2:** 

**Sampling Method:** Convenience sampling

**Advantages:** Quick and easy access to participants, which makes for fast and cost-effective data collection (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). 

The Research conducted by Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) utilized covinience sampling as the participants were selected specifically from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who were easily accessible to the researchers. The authors admisnistered a self-administered questionnaire to the students ages 18 -24 years old from the university of Witwatersrand. The researchers clearly had easy acess to students at this university as the sample was taken from a single university, which is a clear example of convenience sampling as the name suggest (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 3:**

**Sampling Method:** Stratified random sampling and purposive sampling

**Advantages:** The advantage of stratified randon sampling is that it ensures that the subgroups (strata) within the population are represented efectively (proportionally) according to du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021). This is useful as experiances may differ between the subgroups (faculties). Pruposive sampling allowed the reasearchers in this instance allowed the researchers to select the students council-selected members who matched their specific characteristics of interest, ensuring that each element is aligned with their research du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) identified.

The study conducted by Badaru and Adu (2020) made use of two sampling methods, stratified random sampling for the quantitative component and purposive sampling for the qualitative component. The authors surveyed 372 students from various faculties (strata) within the Eastern Cape university. The population coincides with du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) definition of stratified random sampling being the population was divided into clear subgroups (faculties) and then a random sample was taken from each subgroup. Purposive sampling was utilized for the qualitative component of the study where 5 student council-selected members were interviewed through semi-structured interviews. These students were selected as they posed certian key characteristics that the researchers wanted to study, which is a clear example of purposive sampling (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).
