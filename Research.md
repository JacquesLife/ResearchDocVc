## Question 1

### Q1.1 

### Article 1

**Paradigm:** Interpretivism

Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) study aligns with the interpretivist paradigm. The authors stated their qualitative study is underpinned by the interpretivist paradigm and aims to explore postgraduate students' experiences with research ethics to gain an understanding of the hurdles students encounter when applying for ethics clearance and how they overcome them (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). This study is interpretivism being a qualitative study which aims to understand subjective experiences and human interests to gain insight into meanings and interpretations (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Article 2

**Paradigm:** Positivism

Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje's (2019) study aligns with the positivist paradigm as the authors state they made use of a "quantitative and positivist approach". The research demonstrates positivist telltales through quantitative data collection using a self-administered questionnaire with 263 young participants and statistical analysis via SPSS 22 and IBM Amos 22 (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The study makes use of hypothesis testing to measure relationships between loyalty programs and consumer behaviour, aiming to establish measurable findings which is a hallmark of positivist research.

### Article 3
 
**Paradigm:** Critical realism

Badaru and Adu (2020) employed a critical realist approach, combining questionnaires (Quantitative) and semi-structured interviews (Qualitative) to gather data. The authors sent out questionnaires to 372 students and conducted interviews with 5 student council-selected members (Badaru and Adu, 2020). Given these multiple data collection methods we can classify the study as critical realism as it integrates both quantitative and qualitative approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of the research problem (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). 

### Q1.2

**Article 1**

**Research Methodology:** Qualitative

Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) state that they conducted a "qualitative exploratory study". This is further reinforced by the use of semi-structured interviews which is a common qualitative data collection method according to Busetto, Wick and Gumbinger (2020). The authors used deductive coding to transcribe and analyze the data collected from the interviews, which is a typical approach in qualitative research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). Verbatim quotes were used from the interviews to reinforce the findings, this is another common practice in qualitative research to provide insight into participants' experiences (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 2** 

**Research Methodology** Quantitative

Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) employed a quantitative research methodology to investigate the influence of loyalty programs on South African youth's repeat purchase behaviour. This statement is reinforced by the author's use of a self-administered questionnaire adapted from previous similar studies with data measured using a 7-point Likert scale (Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje, 2019). The Likert scale is commonly used to measure attributes numerically so the finding can be statistically analyzed which primarily aligns with quantitative research methodologies (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The author's study also tested 6 hypotheses using statistical analysis with SPSS 22 and IBM Amos 22, which is a hallmark of quantitative research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 3** Mixed methods

Badaru and Adu (2020) use of stratified random sampling to select 372 students for a questionnaire survey indicating that the authors want to collect metric data which is a common practice in quantitative research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The authors also conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 student council-selected members which is a common qualitative data collection method (Busetto, Wick and Gumbinger, 2020). The combination of these two approaches allows us to conclude that the study is mixed methods as both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were used to conduct the research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q1.3

**Research Problem:** A research problem is a statement, question, or issue that a researcher wants to investigate or understand, setting the stage for the entire research process (Madhu et al., 2024).

**Article 1:** 

**Problem Statement:** Lack of sufficient sufficient qualitative research on the experiences of postgraduate students in South Africa regarding research ethics and the ethical clearance process.

The problem statement in Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi's (2023) article align well with the definition of a research problem presented above as it identifies a specific issue (Postgraduate students' experiences with research ethics and the ethical clearance process) and highlights a gap in existing literature (lack of sufficient qualitative research on this topic). Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) problem statement fits Madhu et al. (2024) identified criteria of a research problem statement as it provides a clear focus for their study and sets the stage for further investigation.

**Article 2:**

**Problem Statement:** Poor understanding, particularly within emerging markets regarding the youth and how loyalty programs influence their repeat purchase behavior, considering the mediating role of customer satisfaction, trust, and commitment. 

By dicecting the problem statement in Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje's (2019) article, it is evident that it matches Madhu et al. (2024) definition of a research problem as it identifies a specific issue (poor understanding of loyalty programs' influence on repeat purchase behavior among South African youth) and highlights a gap in existing literature (Poor understanding of this topic within emerging markets). We can conclude that the problem statement in Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje's (2019) article provides a clear focus for their study and leaves room for further exploration (Madhu et al., 2024).

**Article 3:** 

**Problem Statement:** low political participation among university students in South Africa and the lack of empirical research data examining the relationship between media use and political participation.

The research problem fits the criteria as it identifies a specific issue (low political participation) and highlights a gap in existing research (lack of empirical data on media use and political participation) according to Badaru and Adu (2020). The problem statement fits the identified criteria of a research problem as it sets the stage for their study by addressing a specific issue that requires further investigation and understanding (Madhu et al. 2024).

### Q1.4

**Article 1:** 

**Population** Post graduate students who have completed their studies and graduated from South African universities.

Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi's (2023) focused on postgraduate students who graduated between the years 2018 and 2021 from South African universities with a master or doctoral degree. The sample group according to Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) consisted of "12 participants 8 being master's students and 4 being doctoral students". The indaviduals were selected from 8 different universities across 5 provinces in South Africa each representing different fields of study (Sciences, Humanities, and Management). These are finely selected individuals the researcher wants to study being a target population (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Population Parameters:** 
- Postgraduate students from South African universities
- Various fields of study (Sciences, Humanities, Management)
- Graduation period: 2018-2021
- Degree types: Master's and doctoral

**Article 2:** 

**Population** South African youth who are members of loyalty programs

Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) population consists of South African youth who are members of loyalty programs. The sample group covered consisted of students from the University of Witwatersrand (77.6% female and 22.4% male) where over 50% of students were aged 18 - 20 years old. The students all participated in various loyalty schemes within a range of industries (food, clothing, and health and beauty sectors). This makes for a clear target population as defined by du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) as a clearly defined group of individuals which the researchers aims to study.

**Population Parameters:**
- South African youth (18-24 years)
- Loyalty program members
- Customer satisfaction levels
- Repeat purchase behavior patterns
- Trust and commitment perceptions

**Article 3:**

**Population** University students in South Africa

Badaru and Adu (2020) focuses on university students in South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province with the sample including 60.5% male and 39.5% female students within the age range of 21 - 25 years old. The following match du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) criteria for a target population a specific accessible group of individuals that the researcher wants to study.

**Population Parameters:** 
- University enrollment demographics
- Age distribution (21-25 years)
- Media consumption patterns
- Political participation levels

## Q1.5

**Article 1:**

**Sampling Method:** Purposive sampling and snowball sampling 

**Advantages:** Set charecteristics of participants ensure that the sample is relevant to the research problem meaning they all provide value (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout 2021). With snowball sampling the advantage is locating difficult-to-reach participants and streamlines this process (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) research falls into the category of purposive sampling and snowball sampling. We can see the element of purposive sampling as the authors specifically selected postgraduate students who had graduated from South African universities between 2018 and 2021. These participants match key characteristics identfied by the researchers then selected based on these same characteristics (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). Snowball sampling is also evident in the study as the researchers used Twitter to recruit participants, asking those who already participated to retweet the post to expand the particapant pool. Since refferals were used to increase the sample size, this is a clear example of snowball sampling (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 2:** 

**Sampling Method:** Convenience sampling

**Advantages:** Quick and easy access to participants, which makes for fast and cost-effective data collection (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). 

Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) utilized covinience sampling as the participants were selected specifically from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who were easily accessible to the researchers. The authors admisnistered a self-administered questionnaire to the students ages 18 -24 years old from the university of Witwatersrand. The researchers clearly had easy acess to students at this university as the sample was taken from a single university, which is a clear example of convenience sampling as the name suggest (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 3:**

**Sampling Method:** Stratified random sampling and purposive sampling

**Advantages:** Stratified randon sampling ensures that the subgroups (strata) within the population are represented efectively (proportionally) according to du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021). Pruposive sampling allowed the reasearchers to select the students council-selected members who matched their specific characteristics of interest, ensuring that each element is aligned with their research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

Badaru and Adu (2020) made use of stratified random sampling for the quantitative component and purposive sampling for the qualitative component. The authors surveyed 372 students from various faculties (strata) within the Eastern Cape university. The population coincides with du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) definition of stratified random sampling being the population was divided into clear subgroups (faculties) and then a random sample was taken from each subgroup. Purposive sampling was utilized for the qualitative component of the study where 5 student council-selected members were interviewed through semi-structured interviews. These students were selected as they had certian key characteristics that the researchers wanted to study, indicating pruposive sampling (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q1.6

**Article 1:**

**Data Collection Method:** Personal semi-structured interviews

Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) utilised semi-structured interviews as their feild primary data collection method. They interviewed 12 postgraduate students through MS Teams in 50 - 60 minute interview sessions (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). One researcher conducted the interviews transcribing the auido and taking verbatim quotes from the participants (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). By analyzing this approach we can clearly see that the authors took a semi-structured approach to the interviews as they asked open-ended questions, allowed for follow-up questions, and allowed the participants to share their experiences in their own words (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). 

**Article 2:**

**Data Collection Method:** Self-administered questionnaire 

The research conducted by Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) utilized a self-administered questionnaires to collect data from their participants. The authors sampled 263 students ages 18 - 24 utilising a 7-point Likert scale to measure the participants' responses (Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje, 2019). This is an example of self-administered questionnaires as the participants completed the questionnaire without the presence of the researchers in their own time (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). 

**Article 3:**

**Data Collection Method:** Questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews

Badaru and Adu (2020) utilized a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews as their data collection methods. The authors sent questionnaires to 372 students from various faculties within the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. This matches du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) definition of a questionnaire survey as it most likely consisted of closed-ended questions admisntered to a large sample size to collect quantitative data. The authors used semi-structured interviews with 5 student student council members to gather qualitative data. The interviews had a researcher present to ask questions and get follow-up responses from the participants, which indicates that the authors used a semi-structured approach to the interviews (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q1.7

**Article 1:**

**Key Findings:** The authors Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) found the following key findings in their study:

- 58% of had not recieved any formal research ethics training.
- 69% of students did receive support and guidance from academic supervisors.
- 67% of students where unfamiliar with their unversity's research ethics policy.
- 93% of students had a positve perception of the research ethics clearance process.

**Implications** Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) made the assumption that ethical clearance is crucial when conducting research with people and that postgraduate students frequently use human participants in their research. Once the research had been conducted Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) concluded that more research is needed within the topic of research ethics and that more teaching support should be provided to postgraduate students in South Africa.

**Article 2:**

**Key Findings:** Sipihiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) noticed the following key findings in their study:

- All 6 hypotheses were supported. 
- loyalty programs have a postive and direct influence on customer satisfaction, trust, and commitment.
- Customer satisfaction has a direct influence on repeat purchase behavior.
- Customer satisfaction is a significant mediator between loyalty programs and repeat purchase behavior.

**Implications** The authors Sipihiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) believe that loyalty programs are a great retention tool for bussinesses to maintain a customer base and that their primary value lies in increasing sales amongst loyal customers. In conducting this study due to the lack of empirical research on the topic the authors Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) were able to reinforce and test their hypotheses. 

**Article 3:**
**Key Findings:**
- 65.3% of students primarily used social media for political information
- 49.2% voted in SRC elections
- 30.4% participated in 2014 National Elections
- Media use positively influences political participation

**Key Findings:** The authors Badaru and Adu (2020) noted the following key findings within their study:

- The majority of students 65.3% used social media as their primary source of political information.
- 49.2% of students voted for Student Representative Council (SRC) members.
- 30.4% of students voted in the 2014 National Elections.
- Media use has a postitve influence on political participation.

**Implications:** Badaru and Adu (2020) believe that the survival of democracy in South Africa depends on active politcal participation and that South African democracy is at risk due to low political participation rates amongst the youth. Badaru and Adu (2020) suggest that mass media usage is a crucial vector in increasing political participation and that digitization is reshaping the political landscape in South Africa, therfore tapping into this potential will be crucial for increasing political participation rates amongs the youth.

### Q1.8

**Article 1:** Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) ensured the validity of their study by making use of a technique called member checking. This technique invloves sharing the research findings with the participants to ensure that they have accuratly captured their experiences and interpretations (Birt et al., 2016). The authors also utlised data source traingulation were multiple data soruces are used to collect data which enhances the credibility of the findings (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The researchers also ensured that they obtain the neccessary ethical clearance from participants before conducting interviews which ensures intergrity(Birt et al., 2016). By ensuring both vailidity and reliability the authors Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) are able to provide a trustworthy and credible study according to Eldridge (2015).

**Article 2:** Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) adapted research intrauments from previous studies to ensure validity and reliability. To further enhance this Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) conducted a pre-test questionnaire with 10 students to ensure that the questions are clear and understandable to the participants. Finally various statistical tests were done to ensure the reliability of the model and the data collected Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023). All the above factor contribute to the trustworhiness of the study by combining both reliability and validity techniques and tests we can conclude that the study matches the criteria for trustworthiness as identified by Eldridge (2015). 

**Article 3:** 
Badaru and Adu (2020) sought the opinions of experts in their feild to validate their data collection instruments as well as conducted a pilot test to further test their research instruments for reliability. Finaly to ensure intergrity the authors obtiained the necessary ethical clearance and approval from the university of Fort Hare before conducting the study. By ensuring these three pillars of trustworthiness (validity, reliability, and integrity) the authors Badaru and Adu (2020) were able to provide a trustworthy and credible study matching the criteria laid out by Ahmed (2024) and Eldridge (2015). 

### Q1.9

**Article 1:** Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) were aware of the ethical implications of their research approaching it with diligence. Before conducting the study the authors an informative letter was sent to all potential participants explaining the purpose of the study as well as a consent form. During the interviews formal consent was obtained again with participants signing a consent form before the interview began (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). Psudonnymes were given to participants to ensure their anoymity and confidentiality (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). The authors still faced challenges after the interviews such as not providing the university names in the reoprting phase and the secure storage of the audio recordings and transcripts (Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi, 2023). The researchers Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) clearly took precautions and made an effect to ensure that participants responses and identities were confedential (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 2:** Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) didnt dive deep into the ethical implications within their research paper. Before the study was conducted the authors Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) did not mention any ethical clearance or consent forms being sent to the participants. However, the stated that the did ensure visibility through the completion of the self-administered questionnaire to maintain data quality during the data collection process. The authors used convenience sampling and stated that their is no guarantee that participants were transparent in their responses (Siphiwe Dlamini and Chinje, 2019). Their is also no mention of secure data storage after the study was conducted which is a necessary step in ethical research (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). The nature of the study did not require ecessive clearance or ethical implications or the authors did not mention it in their published paper. The lack of depth and transparency into ethical issues within the study does raise concerns about the study's integrity (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 3:** Badaru and Adu (2020) obtained ethical clearance from the university of Fort Hare before conducting the study to ensure ligitimacy and integrity. During the study itself the authors made an effort to explain the purpose of the study to the participants and obtain formal consent before participating in the study (Badaru and Adu, 2020). However, the authors did not mention anyhting about anonymity, confidentiality and secure response storage after the study was conducted. The authors did take ethics into account for the most part adressing how the handle ethics within the before and during stage however, seemed to overlook the after stage of the research process. This is still a noble effort matching most of the criteria set out by du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) for ethical research.

### Q1.10

**Article 1:** 

**Gaps/Limitations and Unxeplored Aspects:** Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) study has multiple limiations including the small sample size of 12 participants Limited to 8 different universities in South Africa and the COVID-19 pandemic which disrupted normal academic processes. Snowball sampling also skewed the distrabution as the majority of participants were from Bussiness related feilds. Future research could include a larger sample size across multiple unviersities and fields of study to gain a more comprehensive understanding of postgraduate students' experiences with research ethics and the ethical clearance process. 


**Article 2:** 

**Gaps/Limitations and Unexplored Aspects:** Sipihiwe Dlamini and Chinje (2019) study was limited to the University of Witwatersrand within the Gauteng province, had narrow age parameters, lacked Qualitative data on a research topic that seems quite subjective and did not
take types of loyalty programs into account. Future research should expand to mulitiple universities, include qualitative data collection mmethods, and consider the different types of loyalty programs to gain a more in depth understanding of the topic.

**Article 3:** 

**Gaps/Limitations and Unexplored Aspects:** Badaru and Adu (2020) study had several limiting factors including thhe study was conducted at one university in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, focused primarliy one Facebook and Twitter neglating new popular platforms (TikTok and Instagram), excluded non-student youth and did not consider provincial effects (cultural, economic, and political) on media use and political participation. Similiar to article 2 future research should expand geographically, include more social media platforms and take into account the non-student youth to gain a more comprehensive understanding on the reasearch topic.



## Question 2:

### Q2.1

**Article 1:** Post Graduate Students’ Experiences with Research Ethics: A South African Perspective

**Alternate Paradigm:** Positivism 

**Article 2:** The influence of loyalty programs on South African Youth’s repeat purchase behaviour

**Alternate Paradigm:** Critical Realism

**Article 3:** University Students’ Media Use and Political Participation in South Africa

**Alternate Paradigm:** Interpretivism

### Q2.2

### Q2.2.1

**Article 1:** Post Graduate Students’ Experiences with Research Ethics: A South African Perspective

**Research Problem:** The lack of sufficient imperical research on South African students examining the relationship formal ethics training, instatutional support has on their understanding of research ethics and the ethical clearance process. This adapted research problem aligns better with the positivist approach as it now aims to measure the relationship between variables through observable data (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q2.2.2

**Research Questions:**

1. What is the relationship between formal ethics training and postgraduate students' understanding of the research ethics and ethical clearance process?

2. What is the relationship between institutional support levels and the ethics compliance mannerisms of postgraduate students?

3. What percentage of postgraduate students have formal ethics training in South African universities?

### Q2.2.3
**Hypotheses:** Postgraduate students who have received formal ethics training will handle the ethical clearance process more effectively than those who have not received formal ethics training.

### Q2.2.4

**Target Population:** All students enrolled in posgraduate programs conducting research requiring ethical clearance at South African universities.

**Accessible Population:** Postgraduate students enrolled in research programs across seperate universities within South Africa who can be reached through mail or official university channels.

**Parameters:** 

- Students enrolled in postgraduate programs (Master's and Doctoral).
- Students who have completed or are currently conducting research requiring ethical clearance.

**Unit of analysis:** Individual postgraduate students


**Article 2:** The influence of loyalty programs on South African Youth’s repeat purchase behaviour

### Q2.2.1

**Research Problem:** Young customers experiances with loyalty programs and how it influences their repeat purchase behavior. With critical being the alternate paradigm, the research now takes a more subjective approach to understanding customers' experiences and perceptions of loyalty programs as well as the intial quantitative appraoch (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q2.2.2

**Research Questions:**

1. The experiences of the South African youth with retail loyalty programs?
2. Do loyalty programs influence customer satisfaction among South African youth?
3. What are customers' perceptions of trust and commitment towards loyalty programs?

### Q2.2.3

**Hypotheses:** The experiences of South African youth with loyalty programs will positively influence their repeat purchase behavior.

### Q2.2.4

**Target Population:** South African youth (ages 18-24) who are members of loyalty programs.

**Accessible Population:** Selected participants aged 18-24 who are members of loyalty programs and can be reached through email, social media, or university channels.

**Parameters:** 

- Youth aged 18 - 24 years old.
- Must be members of loyalty programs.
- Willing to be interviewed or complete a questionnaire.

**Unit of analysis:** Indavidual youth particapnts who are members of loyalty programs.


**Article 3:** University Students’ Media Use and Political Participation in South Africa

### Q2.2.1

**Research Problem:** As thier is a decline in political participation among university students in South Africa, it is emperative to understand students perceptions and understanding how there use of media influences their political participation. This alternative interpretivist apprach seeks to uderstand the subjective experiences of students rather than just measuring observable data (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q2.2.2
**Research Questions:**
1. How do university students in South Africa use media to engage with politics?
2. How do university students perceive the influence of media on their political participation?
3. Have students ever participated in political activities as a result of media exposure?

### Q2.2.3
**Research Objectives:**
1. To understand which media vectors university students in South Africa use to engage with politics.
2. To explore students perceptions of the influence of media on their political participation.
3. Understanding what causes students to participate in political activities as a result of media exposure.
   
### Q2.2.4

**Target Population:** university students in South Africa who use media.

**Accessible Population:** University students from various backgrounds who are willing to share their medua use and political participation experiences through interviews. 

**Parameters:**

- University students in South Africa.
- Must use media (social media, news, etc.) to engage with politics.
- Willing to participate in interviews.

**Unit of analysis:** Indavidual university students who use media to engage with politics.

### Q2.2.5 

**Article 1:**

**Sampling Method:** Stratified random sampling 

With a more quantitative approach to the study conducted by Makola and Ntoyanto-Tyatyantsi (2023) we will have to revaluate the sampling method to accommodate the new research problem and objectives. Stratified random sampling fits the requirments as it allows us to divide the postgraduate student into subgorups (strata) based on characteristics such as field of study, university type , and level of education (Master's or Doctoral). With this method we can ensure genralised measurable findings across the entire population of postgraduate students according to du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021). I believe this approach is appropriate for the alternate paradigm of positivism as it seeks to enlighten and measure the relationship between variables (observable data) rather than just understanding subjective experiences which alligns with du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021) definition of positivism.

**Article 2:**

**Sampling Method:** Mixed methods sampling (stratified random sampling and purposive sampling)

With the new paradigm being critical realism, we will have to combine elements of both quantitative and qualitative sampling methods to match this new criteria. Once agian I believe stratisfied random sampling is the best approach as it allows us to divide the youth population into subgroups (strata) based on characteristics such as age, type of loyalty program, and geographic location. This will helps us classify our quantitative data and ensure that we represent the youth population effectively according to du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout (2021). For the qualitative component we can make use of purposive sampling to indentify set characteristics of participants, esspecially when conducting interviews (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). With this combined approach we can meet the criteria for critical realism and gain a deeper understanding of the youth's experiences with loyalty programs while still measuring observable data (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 3:**

**Sampling Method:** Snoqwball sampling

Snowball sampling is the best approach for the new interpretivist paradigm as it allows us to reach a wide range of participants through referrals from existing participants. This method is effective for qualitative research and as a parameter already being media users it may make it easier to find participants (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). This can also help to expand behond the university setting and reach more diverse participants who use media to engage with politics. I believe snowballing to be a suitable approach for this study as it allows us to gather large amounts of qualitative data from a diverse group of participants with a focus on volume giving us a deep insight into the subjective experiences of university students in South Africa (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q2.2.6

**Article 1:**

**Data Collection Method:** Questionnaire survey

With the newly identified positivist paradigm, a questionnaire would be more appropriate form of data collection as it allows for the collection of quantitative data from a larger sample size. A Likert scale questionnaire to be more specfic would allow us to identify patterns and statistical relationships between variables such as formal ethics training, institutional support, and understanding of the ethical clearance process (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). With this numerical data collect researchers can then analyze the effectiveness of formal ethics training and institutional support on postgraduate students' to prove the hypothesis that postgraduate srudents who have received formal ethics training will handle this process more effectively than those who have not.

**Article 2:** Questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews

To achive the goals of the critical realism paradigm, we will need to take a mixed methods approach collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. With this being said we can acheive this by using a questionnaire survey to collect quantitative data on the youth's experiences with loyalty programs and their repeat purchase behavior. For the qualitative component we can use semi-structured interviews to gain a subjective understanding of the youth's perceptions and experiences with loyalty programs. With this approach we can collect observable data and gain an undestanding of social phenomena align with the critical realism paradigm (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 3:** Focus groups 

To successfully collect qualitative data for the interpretivist paradigm, we can employ focus groups as our data collection method. Focus groups guided by a facilitator can help us collectively explore the subjective experiences of university students regarding their media use and political participation. This can promote open discussions and cause the students to share their experiences in a more natural and interactive setting (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). Another benifit is to gather shared experiances giving us a deeper understanding of the social phenomena at play. Focus groups are common in interpretivist research as their primary focus is on understanding perceptions and experiences (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

### Q2.2.7 

**Article 1:** 

**Data Analysis Method:** Statistical analysis

With the paradigm change to positivism, we will need to analyze the quantitative data collected from the questionnaire survey. A good apporach would be to use statistical analysis to uncover patterns and relationships between variables such as formal ethics training, institutional support, and understanding of the ethical clearance process. According to Islam (2020) key components of statistical analysis include descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. We can use descriptive statistics to seperate students who have received formal ethics training and represent them as a percentage of the total sample size. Finally we can use inferential statistics to test the hypothesis that postgraduate students who have received formal ethics training will handle the ethical clearance process more effectively than those who have not Islam (2020). 

**Article 2:** 

**Data Analysis Method:** Mixed methods analysis (satistical analysis and thematic analysis)

To incoperate critical realism into the data analysis we will need to analyze both quantitative and qualitative data collected from the purposed questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews. For the quantitative data we can once agian use statistical analysis to find patterns and relationships between the youth's experiences with loyalty programs and their repeat purchase behavior (Islam, 2020). For the qualitative data we can use thematic analysis with deductive coding in the attempt to identify commom themes and patterns amongst the participants' experiences and perceptions of loyalty programs (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). This mixed methods appraoch is appropriate for critical realism as it utilised data analysis methods which measure quantifiable data while also exploring subjective experiences through deductive coding (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).

**Article 3:** Thematic analysis

To analyze the qualitative data collected from focus groups, we should use thematic analysis. Thematic analysis can help us discover patterns and themes within participants responses regarding their media use and political participation (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021). Utilising deductive coding we compare particpants responses to our list of know themes and patterns to isolate all data that informs the research questions. This approach is common is qualitative interpretivist research as it allows us to attempt to understand social phenomena through the subjective experiences of participants (du Plooy-Cilliers, Davis and Bezuidenhout, 2021).
